# nom-that-burger
This is a restaurant app that allows the user to type in and save their favorite burgers to a MySQL database. The burgers appear to the left on the left on the screen as soon as they are saved, and a "Devour Now!" Button also appears next to each burger, allowing the user to click and "eat" the burger, moving it to the right side of the screen. All burgers are saved in the MySQL database.
